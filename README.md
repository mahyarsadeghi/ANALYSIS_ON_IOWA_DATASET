Here will answer several questions regarding this dataset using Pyspark and SQLand finally we will apply a ML algorithm:
1.Total sales for each county and city.
2.How many brands are there total 
3.  Which brands are the most sold / famous? We also find Most famous brands every year. This can reveal some trends that whcih companies are growing faster.
4.  What are the various packaging types and which type of packaging was sold the most ? For example, 750 ml or 100ml etc.
5.  And finally we find correlation between Price of a certain product and other features. For example Correlation between Price and Bottle Volume. The task here is to 
find the best parameter to estimate the price for new products based on other features. Since it is a regression problem, we simply just used linear regression 
to reveal the trend.
We got accuracy of 99 percent on the test set here.
